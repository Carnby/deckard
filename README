How to install

1. 
Make sure you have installed and working WIRE 0.22
http://www.cwr.cl/projects/WIRE

2. 
Build wire-swig. You will have to edit setup.py and change the home_dir variable to the folder that contains WIRE:
home_dir = "/home/egraells/resources"
wire_dir = home_dir + "/WIRE-0.22"

cd wire_swig
python setup.py build

This will create the python bindings for WIRE. The generated .so file will be in a subfolder, you will have to move it into the current folder. Example:
mv build/lib.linux-i686-2.7/_Wire.so .
