Python mash-up to build a web search engine using the Whoosh Search Engine and WIRE, a web crawler. The goal is to have a quick and easy to setup search engine in order to make research on search interfaces.

Dependencies

- WIRE
- Whoosh
- Python 2.7 (not tested on earlier versions). 
- swig
- libxml2

Included in the package

- Justext http://code.google.com/p/justext/
- BeautifulSoup

How to install

1. Make sure you have installed and working WIRE 0.22
http://www.cwr.cl/projects/WIRE

2. Build wire-swig. You will have to edit setup.py and change the home_dir variable to the folder that contains WIRE:
home_dir = "/home/egraells/resources"
wire_dir = home_dir + "/WIRE-0.22"

cd wire_swig
python setup.py build

This will create the python bindings for WIRE. The generated .so file will be in a subfolder, you will have to move it into the current folder. Example:
mv build/lib.linux-i686-2.7/_Wire.so .

Usage

You can use the manager script to control the behavior. Here are some incomplete examples (this assumes that WIRE is properly configured):

Crawling and Indexing
python manager.py --action start --seeds seeds_2011_10_25.txt
python manager.py --action crawl --steps 10
python manager.py --action build-index --indexdir search_index/ --indexname test

Search
python search.py --indexdir search_index/ --indexname test --query graells
